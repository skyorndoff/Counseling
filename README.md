JSky Counseling

### Welcome

Welcome to the webpage for J. Sky Orndoff, Counselor in training at the University of Montana.  Here you can find my intake forms, a bit about my background, orientation, and professional goals.

You can also find out about my other interests such as tiny house living, packrafting, contra dancing, contact improv, and backcountry skiing.
